# RustxG - Mobility Management Entity (MME)

## Overview

The Mobility Management Entity (MME) is a core component of the RustxG project, implementing the control-plane functions of the LTE/4G core network. The MME is responsible for handling signaling between the User Equipment (UE) and the core network, as well as managing bearer paths for data communication.

This repository serves as the implementation of the MME in Rust, leveraging modern language features for safety, performance, and concurrency.

As projects is in not even born, we need to for now just try implement protocols or very basic structures, I do not intend to make things complex with async and etc at this stage and prefer to be intend toward stability and then iterations that check needs and provide or changes base on the needs.

## Requirements

## Roadmap
- provide a sample s1ap structures to provide s1ap interface
- s6a 
- s11
- s1ap

## Challenges
-  gtp implementation
-  sctp implementation
-  ...
