# RustxG - Mobility Management Entity (MME)

## Overview

The Mobility Management Entity (MME) is a core component of the RustxG project, implementing the control-plane functions of the LTE/4G core network. The MME is responsible for handling signaling between the User Equipment (UE) and the core network, as well as managing bearer paths for data communication.

This repository serves as the implementation of the MME in Rust, leveraging modern language features for safety, performance, and concurrency.
